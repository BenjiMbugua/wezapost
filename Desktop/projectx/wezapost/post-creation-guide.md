# 📝 Creating "The Age Resolve" Post - Step by Step Guide

## 🎯 **Your Post Content:**
```
the age resolve
```

## 🚀 **Step-by-Step Instructions:**

### Step 1: Open WezaPost Dashboard
- **URL:** http://localhost:3001/dashboard
- **Expected:** Dashboard interface should load

### Step 2: Authentication (if needed)
- If not logged in, click "Sign in with Google"
- **For demo mode:** You can skip login and use demo features

### Step 3: Connect Twitter Account
1. Look for the "Social Media" or "Social Accounts" section
2. Click "Connect" next to Twitter
3. **Two options:**
   - **Demo Mode:** Instant connection (recommended for testing)
   - **Real OAuth:** Use actual Twitter credentials (posts real tweets)

### Step 4: Create Your Post
1. Navigate to "Create Post" section
2. In the content area, type: `the age resolve`
3. **Character count should show:** 14/280 characters
4. Select Twitter as your target platform (click the Twitter button/checkbox)

### Step 5: Choose Publishing Option
**Option A - Immediate Posting:**
- Keep "Post Now" selected
- Click "Publish Now"

**Option B - Scheduled Posting:**
- Select "Schedule for Later"
- Choose date and time (e.g., 5 minutes from now)
- Click "Schedule Post"

### Step 6: Verify Success
- **Demo Mode:** Will show simulated publishing results
- **Real Mode:** Will post actual tweet to your Twitter account
- Check the "Recent Posts" section to see your post

## 🎭 **Demo Mode vs Real Mode:**

### Demo Mode (Recommended First):
✅ No real tweets posted
✅ Full interface testing
✅ Immediate results
✅ Safe for experimentation

### Real OAuth Mode:
🔗 Posts actual tweets
⚠️ Requires Twitter developer account
⚠️ Creates public content

## 🔧 **If You Encounter Issues:**

### Dashboard Won't Load:
- Check: http://localhost:3001/dashboard
- Ensure development server is running
- Look for any console errors

### Can't Connect Twitter:
- Try demo mode first
- For real OAuth, ensure credentials are configured

### Post Won't Submit:
- Check that content isn't empty
- Ensure at least one platform is selected
- Verify character limits

## 🎉 **Expected Results:**

After successful posting, you should see:
1. Post appears in "Recent Posts" section
2. Status shows as "published" or "scheduled"
3. Platform icons show where it was posted
4. Timestamp shows when it was created/scheduled
